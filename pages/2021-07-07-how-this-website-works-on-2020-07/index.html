    <h1>How this website works on 2021-07</h1>
    <p>Previously this website was built with Gatsby - this was much too complicated.</p>
    <p>
      My main use-case is writing Markdown, converting it to HTML and sticking it on
      the internet. Now it does <em>just</em> that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Converting Markdown to HTML was interesting - There are many packages that can
      do this, but I had some time on my hands so I used
      <a href="https://unifiedjs.com/">unified.js</a>. (Ironically Gatsby uses this under the
      hood.)
    </p>
    <h2>Unified.js</h2>
    <p>
      Unified provides a pipeline for processing "content", which means anything that
      a unified-compatible parser exists for. The idea is to parse Markdown to an
      abstract syntax tree, jiggle the AST a bit, convert that to an HTML AST, perhaps
      jiggle it a bit more and finally compile it to text.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool part of this is the jiggling. Currently it's set up to extract the
      YAML-frontmatter from a Markdown document and insert that at a different place
      in the HTML AST before spitting out some HTML text. Something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">const assignTitle = () => {
    return (node, file) => {
        const html = node.children.find((c) => c.tagName === 'html')
        const head = html.children.find((c) => c.tagName === 'head')
        const title = head.children.find((c) => c.tagName === 'title')
        title.children[0].value = file.data.title
    }
}

export const markdownToHtml = async (path) => {
    const output = await unified()
        .use(remarkParse)
        .use(remarkFrontmatter)
        .use(remarkExtractFrontmatter, { yaml: yaml.parse })
        .use(remark2rehype)
        .use(rehypeDocument, { title: '' })
        .use(assignTitle)
        .use(rehypeStringify)
        .use(rehypeFormat)
        .process(toVFile.readSync(path))

    return { html: output.contents, metadata: output.data }
}
</code></pre>
