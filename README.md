# NOTES

Stick notes in here.

- Make markdown files in `./markdown` and run `npm run build-markdown-pages` (this creates html pages in `./pages/`)
- Update `./pages/index.html` and push.

Remember to add frontmatter to the markdown pages, eg:

```
---
title: Page Title
date: 2021-07-07
---

# Page Title

...and the rest of the markdown content
```
